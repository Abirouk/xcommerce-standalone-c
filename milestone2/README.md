## Exercise 2.1
We consider the same problem statement as in Exercise 1.1[https://github.com/oiraqi/xcommerce-standalone-c/tree/master/milestone1#exercise-11]
- Identify all preprocessor directives and explain the purpose of each one
- Write the c program using VS Code
- Compile it using gcc
- Run it and test it

## Exercise 2.2
We consider the same problem statement as in [Exercise 1.2](https://github.com/oiraqi/xcommerce-standalone-c/tree/master/milestone1#exercise-12)
- Identify all preprocessor directives and explain the purpose of each one
- Write the c program using VS Code
