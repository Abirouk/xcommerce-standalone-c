# Milestone 5: Strings
## Problem Statement
In this milestone, we add products names, customers names, as well as customers shipping addresses. Also, instead of specifying the product index, customers will specify the product name. The operator shall be able to list corresponding products based on same-start partial matching (e.g. sam and samsung match partially).

Given these new requirements:
- Enhance your code, by leveraging **strings**
- Compile your code, run and test your executable program
