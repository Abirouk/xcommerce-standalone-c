# Milestone 5: Strings
## Problem Statement
In this milestone, we add product names, customer names, as well as customer shipping addresses. Also, instead of specifying the product index, customers will specify the product name. The operator shall be able to list corresponding products based on same-start partial matching (e.g. sam and samsung match partially).

## Need To Know / Read About
- The limitations of scanf("%s", my_string), when inputing strings from the end user
- How gets(my_string) addresses those limitations, but creates security issues
- How fgets(my_string, SIZE, stdin) is the best option to get strings from the end user
- The need for getcher() 

Given these new requirements:
- Enhance your code, by leveraging **strings**
- Compile your code, run and test your executable program
