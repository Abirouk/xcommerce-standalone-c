# Milestone 7: User-defined Data Types
## Problem Statement
In this milestone, we enhance the code using encapsulation through user-defined data types. We also use dynamic memory allocation extensively.s

## Need To Know / Read About
- typedef struct

Given these new requirements:
- Enhance your code, by leveraging **user-defined data types**
- Replace the statically allocated space for arrays with dynamically allocated memory
- Compile your code, run and test your executable program
