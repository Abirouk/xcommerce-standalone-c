# Milestone 4: Simple Arrays / Multi-dimensional Arrays
## Problem Statement
Here, we will no more be bound to just three products. We will consider a multi-product catalog, i.e., a catalog that can contain any number of products. Moreover, after hadling all customers, Intergalactic Ltd. wants to a have a detailed report about all the placed orders. The report should show:
- the ordered products, their respective quantities and prices, net total price, tax and total price per customer
- the customer with the *lowest* total price, as well as the corresponding net total price, tax and total price
- the customer with the *highest* total price, as well as the corresponding net total price, tax and total price
- the *grand* net total, the *grand* tax and the *grand* total
- the current stock, i.e. the *remaining* quantity of each product.

Given these new requirements:
- Design the high-level algorithm
- Design lower-level algorithms
- Identify the different files that compose your C program
- Give the content of your header file
- Implement the main function
- Partially compile its corresponding file as an object file
- Implement all needed functions, by leveraging **arrays**
- Partially compile their corresponding file(s) as an object file
- Compile and link all oject files to generate your executable program
- Run and test your executable program
