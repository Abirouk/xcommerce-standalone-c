# Telecommerce Application
Welcome to the Telecommerce Application: a holistic and incremental project developed in, and showcasing the C programming language.

## Overview
Intergalactic Ltd. makes a catalog of its products available both online (on its website) and offline (printed format). Customers browse the catalog (online or offline), and call Intergalactic to order selected products (hence *Tele*commerce). An Intergalactic employee answers calls, receives and processes orders.

As orders have been steadily growing, Intergalactic has realized that it needs a program (Telecommerce Application) to allow its employee process calls faster and without errors. As a matter of fact, not only was the process too slow increasing the number of lost customers, but it was also affected by human errors: frequent errors in calculating total price, discount and VAT, other errors were related to stock management, etc.

This project is about developing the Telecommerce Application for Intergalactic company.

## ILOs
- Apply the algorithmic thinking and approach in problem-solving, and be able to express algorithms using pseudo code and flow charts
- Apply C data types, expressions, selections and repetitions, in order to translate algorithms to programs
- Apply the process of writing, compiling, debugging and testing C programs using a modern IDE (currently VS Code), as well as sharing them through a version control system (currently Git)
- Apply the top-down/divide-and-conquer approach for more advanced problems, in order to break them down into simpler sub-problems, while focusing on the high-level solution
- Identify C header and source files required by a program, and be able to organize it accordingly, in order to promote modularity
- Apply various features of C programming including pointers, arrays and strings, and ultimately user-defined data types and files
- Explain the purpose of a C program that is written by others, and analyze whether it compiles and runs successfully

## Starting point
- git clone https://github.com/oiraqi/xcommerce-standalone-c.git
- cd xcommerce-standalone-c
- code .
- There you go!

## Prerequisites
- Git installed
- Gcc (MinGW for Windows) installed
- VS Code installed

## Milestone 1 (Basic specifications, algorithms only)
1.1. We start by considering a single-product catalog. Each customer calls and specifies the quantiy of the product (the only product available) s/he wants to order. The operator shall use the Telecommerce Application to compute the total price.

*=> Identify the problem input and output*
*=> Design the algorithm and express it as a flow chart*
