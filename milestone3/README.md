# Problem Statement
Now, we would like to handle n customers (calls), one after the other. And just like 1.5, each customer may order one or more products from the thtree-product catalog, again and again, until s/he's done. Then the operator, moves to the next customer. Before receiving any call, the operator must first initialize the stock by setting the price and quantity of each product.
